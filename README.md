1. Sketch you layout before you dive in. It will make for a much better layout if you plan ahead.
2. When using floats don't forget to us overflow:hidden on the parent element.
3. Use detailed names when naming your elements. Instead of Box1 & Box2, try header-wrap. Avoid giving everything a class when you can modify it with nesting.
